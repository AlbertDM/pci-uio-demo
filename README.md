# pci-uio-demo

PCI driver sample based on uio

This repository contains a simple PCIe NIC driver for learning purposes. The driver is based on UIO (Userspace I/O) to provide an accessible starting point for understanding PCIe device drivers.

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a basic PCIe NIC driver to gain insights into Linux kernel module development, PCI device interaction, and network driver fundamentals. It serves as a foundation for further exploration into high-performance NIC drivers and technologies like DPDK, IOMMU, DMA, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Linux machine with PCI slots
- Basic knowledge of Linux kernel development

### Building and Installing
1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the driver.
3. Install the driver.
4. Load the driver.
5. Begin experimenting with your NIC.

## Future Directions

While this project focuses on a basic UIO-based driver, you can explore the following topics to advance your understanding of high-performance NIC drivers and DPDK:
- **DPDK Integration**: Investigate integrating your driver with DPDK for high-speed packet processing.
- **IOMMU**: Explore IOMMU (Input/Output Memory Management Unit) for improved memory isolation and protection.
- **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: Learn about DMA for efficient data transfer between devices and memory.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize your driver for maximum network throughput.
